# Django-CRM-project

In this project, I tried to showcase my Django skills by building a small CRM system. 
I have created basic functionalities that almost every web app needs to have such as authentication and permissions. 
I connected my app to a Postgresql DB and used the ORM functionality in Django to save data and make queries within the app.
Also, I made use of Bootstrap and its components to simplify the process of creating elements like forms, messages, and other HTML components.
